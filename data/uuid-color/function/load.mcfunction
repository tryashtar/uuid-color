# lookup table for XOR on two nibbles (4-bit values)
# if we used execute store instead of data modify, we wouldn't need to store any with the output of 0, since the lookup failing will yield that result, but I like data modify better
# we could store fewer entries by passing in values in a fixed order, but swapping is probably slower than just making the table large
